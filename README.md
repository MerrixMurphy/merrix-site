# merrix-site
A website for the developer, by the developer, about the developer.

This website was made as a developer page for myself as well as a showcase of my work. This would generally be something I have future employeers or teams view to get an understanding of both my background and my personality. 

Merrix is a developer from Nevada, Las Vegas who started as an android coder before transitioning to web. With an educational background in English and a technical background through Thinkful as well as the languages CSS, HTML, JS, and Kotlin, he believes that with a little imagination, you can do anything, and the more skills you aqcuire, the more tools you have for your imagination.
