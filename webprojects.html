					<p>Until Covid, I never really found my way into the developing world, instead I focused my efforts on maintaining life
						after university with my wonderful partner. Once I finally had free time, I decided to explore an app named <a href="https://grasshopper.app/"
						 target=b lank>Grasshopper</a>. From there I excelled and soon wanted to make my own apps. Discovering Android Studio
						and Kotlin, I started doing just that. Eventually, I found a Bootcamp called Thinkful. This Bootcamp is what I am currently
						in, but it has already given me the basic foundation I lacked while learning on my own.</p>

				<p>These are the websites I have made:</p>

<!--Description for each project-->

<p>A Shoot-em-up made for itch.io's "My First Game Jam: Summer 2021." 
	This is the first game I helped to develop with a group of friends. 
	It was also my first introduction to Unity and the game development world.</p>
